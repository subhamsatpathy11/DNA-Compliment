# DNA-Compliment
DNA occurs as a double strand where each A is paired with a T and vice versa, and each C is paired with a G and vice versa. The reverse complement of a DNA sequence is formed by reversing the letters, interchanging A and T and interchanging C and G.

# Approach
We have not used any predefined functions to execute the DNA Compliment Algorithm. The code is robust and is compiled for each test case, the replace functions are written from scratch to ensure no runtime error occurs.

# Technology and packages
We have used the following,

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python3
- No packages imported

# Conclusion
We have successfully calculated the compliment of the characters considered and reversed the final string to get the desired output.
